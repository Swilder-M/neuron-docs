# HTTP API

The IIoT platform or any other monitoring application can effectively monitor and control Neuron devices by utilizing the provided HTTP APIs. The key features of these APIs are:

[Acquiring Data:](./rw.md) The HTTP APIs enable the platform to monitor the acquired data from devices connected to the IIoT platform. This allows for real-time monitoring of sensor readings, operational parameters, and device status.

[Control Commands:](./rw.md) The APIs also facilitate sending control commands to the Neuron devices, enabling the platform to remotely control and manage the devices. This allows for seamless management of device functionalities.

[Remote Setup and Configuration:](./configuration.md) The platform can remotely set up and configure device connections using the HTTP APIs. This ensures convenient and efficient management of the devices without the need for physical access. [Plugin Settings](./plugin-setting.md) is also available.

[JWT Authentication:](./jwt.md) The APIs employ JWT authentication, ensuring secure communication and authentication between the IIoT platform or monitoring application and the Neuron devices. This enhances the overall security of the system.

[Prometheus-Compatible Metrics:](./metrics.md) The API provides Prometheus-compatible metrics data. This allows for easy integration with Prometheus monitoring tools, facilitating efficient monitoring and analysis of device metrics.

[Data Type Descriptions:](./data-type.md) To ensure clarity and consistency in data representation and interpretation, the API describes the data types used. This promotes seamless data integration and analysis within the IIoT platform or monitoring application.

[Error Code Descriptions:](./error-code.md) The API includes comprehensive error code descriptions, providing information about the nature and cause of any encountered errors. This assists in effective troubleshooting and issue resolution.
