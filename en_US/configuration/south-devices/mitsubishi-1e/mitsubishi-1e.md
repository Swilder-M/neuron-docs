#### .BIT

It can only be used in **non-bit type area**, which means to read the specified bit of the specified address, and the binary bit index range is [0, 15].

| Address | Data Type | Description                  |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| D20.0   | bit       | D area, address is 20, bit 0 |
| D20.2   | bit       | D area, address is 20, bit 2 |

#### .LEN\[H]\[L]

When the data type is string, **.LEN** indicates the length of the string;   **H** and **L** can be optional to indicate two byte orders, the default is **H** byte order.
