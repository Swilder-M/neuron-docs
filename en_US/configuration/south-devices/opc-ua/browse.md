# Browse OPC UA Address Space

NeuronEX integrates the Address Space Browser function for OPC UA servers, which helps users to get the tags information in the connected OPC UA servers, including the tag's location information in the server model, the tag's access address, and the tag's type information. The tags can be quickly added to the collection group.

## How to use
1. In the **Southbound Devices** list, click **Device Configuration** in the OPC UA Node Operations menu.
