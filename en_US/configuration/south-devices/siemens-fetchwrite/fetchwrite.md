# Siemens FetchWrite

Fetch/Write is a TCP/IP-based communication protocol that facilitates crucial data exchange between PLC and associated systems including SCADA, HMI devices, and other PLCs. In this setup, the 'Fetch' operation retrieves data from the PLC, while the 'Write' operation allows for data input into the PLC, ensuring a seamless data flow for optimized automation processes.

Neuron Siemens FetchWrite plugin is used for accessing Siemens PLCs with network expansion module CP443, such as s7-300/400.

## Add Device

Go to **Configuration -> South Devices**, then click **Add Device** to add the driver. Configure the following settings in the popup dialog box.

- Name: The name of this device node.
- Plugin: Select the **Siemens FetchWrite** plugin.

## Device Configuration

After clicking **Create**, you will be redirected to the **Device Configuration** page, where we will set up the parameters required for Neuron to establish a connection with the northbound application. You can also click the device configuration icon on the southbound device card to enter the **Device Configuration** interface.

| Parameter          | Description                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **PLC IP Address** | Remote plc ip                 |
| **PLC Port**       | Rsemote plc port, default 102 |

## Configure Data Groups and Tags

After the plug-in is added and configured, the next step is to establish communication between your device and Neuron by adding groups and tags to the Southbound driver.

Once device configuration is completed, navigate to the **South Devices** page. Click on the device card or device row to access the **Group List** page. Here, you can create a new group by clicking on **Create**, then specifying the group name and data collection interval.

Upon successfully creating a group, click on its name to proceed to the **Tag List** page. This page allows you to add device tags for data collection. You'll need to provide information such as the tag address, attributes, and data type.

For information on general configuration items, see [Connect to Southbound Devices](../south-devices.md). The subsequent section will concentrate on configurations specific to the driver.

#### .BIT

Optional, refers to a certain digit of a certain address.

#### .LEN

When the data type is a string type, it is a required item, indicating the length of the string.
