# Siemens S7300 PLC Connection Example

The S7300 is a member of the Siemens S7 family of PLCs. Suitable for large and complex automation applications, this PLC offers high performance and rich functionality.

This section describes how to connect the S7300 via the Neuron Siemens MPI plug-in.

## Connecting Hardware Devices

1. Use adapter 0CA23 to connect to the MPI interface of the S7-300.
