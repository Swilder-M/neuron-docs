# Siemens S7 ISOTCP

Siemens S7 ISOTCP is a protocol developed by Siemens for communication with Siemens S7 series PLCs. This protocol is based on the TCP/IP protocol stack and uses the ISO-TSAP protocol for handling connections and data transmission. It enables read and write operations on various data types of the PLC, including bits, bytes, word, double word, timers, and counters.

The implementation of S7 ISOTCP in Neuron is divided into two plugins. 

- The Siemens S7 ISOTCP plugin is mainly used to connect to PLC modules such as Siemens S200, S200smart, S1200, and S1500. 
- The Siemens S7 ISOTCP for 300/400 plugin is mainly used to connect to PLC modules such as Siemens S300 and S400 that have an Ethernet module.

## Add Device

Go to **Configuration -> South Devices**, then click **Add Device** to add the driver. Configure the following settings in the popup dialog box.

- Name: The name of this device node.
- Plugin: Select the **Siemens S7 ISOTCP** plugin or **Siemens S7 ISOTCP for 300/400**.

| Plugin                        | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Siemens S7 ISOTCP             | For Siemens S200, S200smart, S1200, S1500 PLC |
| Siemens S7 ISOTCP for 300/400 | For Siemens S300, S400 PLC                    |

## Device Configuration

After clicking **Create**, you will be redirected to the **Device Configuration** page, where we will set up the parameters required for Neuron to establish a connection with the northbound application. You can also click the device configuration icon on the southbound device card to enter the **Device Configuration** interface.

::: tip
When interfacing with Siemens S7 1200/1500 PLC using the Siemens S7 ISOTCP plugin, certain modifications are required in the Siemens software (TIA16) settings:

* The `optimized block access` must be turned off.
* The `access level` must be **full** and the **connection mechanism** must allow GET/PUT.

For detailed operating steps, please refer to [Tailor S7 1200/1500 PLC for Effective ISOTCP Plugin Use](./plc/siemens-s7-1200-1500.md).

## Configure Data Groups and Tags

After the plug-in is added and configured, the next step is to establish communication between your device and Neuron by adding groups and tags to the Southbound driver.

Once device configuration is completed, navigate to the **South Devices** page. Click on the device card or device row to access the **Group List** page. Here, you can create a new group by clicking on **Create**, then specifying the group name and data collection interval.

Upon successfully creating a group, click on its name to proceed to the **Tag List** page. This page allows you to add device tags for data collection. You'll need to provide information such as the tag address, attributes, and data type.

For information on general configuration items, see [Connect to Southbound Devices](../south-devices.md). The subsequent section will concentrate on configurations specific to the driver.
