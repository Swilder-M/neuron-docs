# Introduction and Usage of DL/T645-2007

## Module Description

The dlt645 protocol supports serial and tcp connection.

## Parameter Configuration

### Serival

| Parameter         | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **timeout**       | Timeout for sending requests to the device          |
| **inteval**       | read instruction interval(ms)                       |
| **device**        | Use a serial device, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0             |
| **stop**          | stopbits, default 1                                 |
| **parity**        | parity bit, default 2, which means even parity      |
| **baud**          | baudrate, default 9600                              |
| **data**          | bytesize, default 8                                 |

### TCP

| Parameter           | Description         |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **timeout**         | Timeout for sending requests to the device    |
| **inteval**         | read instruction interval(ms)                       |
| **host**            | When neuron is used as a client, host means the ip of the remote device. When used as a server, it means the ip used by neuron locally, and 0.0.0.0 can be filled in by default    |
| **port**            | When neuron is used as client, port means the tcp port of the remote device. When used as a server, it means the tcp port used by neuron locally     |
| **connection mode** | The way the driver connects to the device, the default is client, which means that the neuron driver is used as the client       |

## Supported data types

* UIN8
* UINT16
* UINT32
* UIN64

## Usage of Address Format

### Address format

> mail_address#DI<sub>3</sub>-DI<sub>2</sub>-DI<sub>1</sub>-DI<sub>0</sub> 

* mail_address represents the mailing address of the meter.
* DI<sub>3</sub>-DI<sub>2</sub>-DI<sub>1</sub>-DI<sub>0</sub> represents the data identification, and all points only support read attributes, and expressed in hexadecimal.

E.g 123456789012#02-01-01-00, represents the value of the A-phase voltage of the meter device with the mailing address 123456789012.

:::tip
Support a node to configure multiple mailing addresses, that is a single serial port multi-device connection.

Please refer to the DL/T645-2007 industry standard data coding table for the specific data item name corresponding to the data identifier.

* The data length is 1, and the data type is UINT8.
* The data length is 2, and the data type is UINT16.
* The data length is 3 or 4, and the data type is UINT32.
* The data length is 5 or 6 or 7 or 8, and the data type is UINT64.
* Set the value of **Decimal** according to the data format, e.g, if the data format is XXX.X, then **Decimal** is set to 0.1.
