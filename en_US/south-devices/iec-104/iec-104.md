# Overview

IEC60870-5-104 is a commonly used communication protocol in power automation systems. It uses the TCP/IP protocol as the underlying communication protocol and is used to monitor and control various devices in the power system, such as substations, generators, switches, etc.

Neuron supports the acquisition of remote signaling, remote measurement, and remote pulse (electricity call) data in the form of station interrogation, and supports the control of devices through remote control.
