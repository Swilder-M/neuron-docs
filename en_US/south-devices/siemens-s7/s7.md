# Introduction and Usage of Siemens S7 ISOTCP

The s7comm plugin is used for Siemens PLCs with network port, such as s7-200/300/400/1200/1500.

## Parameter  Configuration

| Parameter | Description                      |
| ---------| -------------------------------- |
| **host** | remote plc ip                 |
| **port** | remote plc port, default 102  |
| **rack** | plc rack number, default 0       |
| **slot** | plc cpu slot, default 1          |

::: tip
When using the S7COMM plugin to access the S7 1200/1500 PLC,  you need to use Siemens software(TIA16) to make some settings for the PLC.( For detailed settings, please refer to [plc-settings](./plc/siemens-s7-1200-1500.md). )
:::

* The optimized block access must be turned off.
* The access level must be "full" and the "connection mechanism" must allow GET/PUT.

## Support Data Type

* INT16
* UINT16
* INT32
* UINT32
* FLOAT
* DOUBLE
* BIT
* STRING

## Usage of Address Format

### Address Format

> AREA ADDRESS\[.BIT][.LEN]

| DB   | int16/uint16/bit/int32/uint32/float/double/string | read/write | global DB block | Variable Memory V, DB index 1 |

*Example:*

| Address | Data Type | Description  |
| ------ | ------- | -------- |
| I0         | int16   | I area, address is 0 |
| I1         | uint16  | I area, address is 1 |
| O2         | int16   | O area, address is 2 |
| O3         | uint16  | O area, address is 3 |
| F4         | int16   | F area, address is 0 |
| F5         | int16   | F area, address is 0 |
| T6         | int16   | T area, address is 0 |
| T7         | int16   | T area, address is 0 |
| C8         | uint16  | C area, address is 0 |
| C9         | uint16  | C area, address is 0 |
| DB10.DBW10 | int16   | In a data block of 10 , the starting data word is 10 |
| DB12.DBW10 | uint16  | In a data block of 12 , the starting data word is 10 |
| DB10.DBW10 | float   | In a data block of 10 , the starting data word is 10 |
| DB11.DBW10 | double  | In a data block of 11 , the starting data word is 10 |

#### .BIT

Optional, referring to a bit of an address.

#### .LEN

When the data type is a string type, it is required and indicates the length of the string.
