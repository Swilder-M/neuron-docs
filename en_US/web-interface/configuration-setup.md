# Configuration Setup

These functions are used to setup the protocol communication details in terms of channel, object, attributes and tag address for data exchange with machine. Events and alarms are also defined in configuration for advance functions.

## Object Setup

Select the object settings option under the configuration menu. This option contains settings for protocol communication details in terms of channels, objects, attributes, and tag addresses.

### Channel Setup

Select &quot;New Driver&quot; button on the page, there are two kinds of channels, hardware communication channel and cloud platform communication channel, as shown in the figure.

Driver communication are used to setup the details for hardware device or PLC communication. Cloud communication are used to setup the communication with cloud platform. MQTT is the only selection at the moment. However, both channels have its own specific communication parameters in a list box.

For driver communication, there are two types communication driver.

Then follow the prompts to set the address. After clicking the "Address" button, a dialog box will be prompted. Set the hardware address in this dialog box. Please refer to the address setting documentation for details of the address string for each driver. If no address is specified or if it is a dummy address, use &quot;-&quot; to indicate that '-' will be displayed in the field.

## Configuration Overview

The configuration overview page is only for overall configuration checking.

## Save New Configuration

After finishing the configuration setup, press the &quot;Send&quot; button to transfer the configuration settings the Neuron system would check up. If it passes the checkup, it would restarts the system to initiate the new configuration. The web interface would be forcibly to logout once system restarts.
